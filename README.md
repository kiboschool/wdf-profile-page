# Project: Your Profile Page

## Introduction

Let's break the habit of poorly styled pages and do something different.

You're going to be making a profile page. Think of it as an online CV. Add
information about yourself, like your education history, hobbies, and an image
that you think best represents you.

This is your time to let your creativity shine and be experimental.

## Your Task

For this project, you're deviating from the CS Professor (lack of) style to make
a full fledged profile page. You'll need to use the CSS you've learned this week
to take your page to the next level.

## Instructions

**Before you get started**

Prepare what you'll need to build the site. Write down all of the facts and info
you'll put on the website. You can use the file `site-plan.md` to take notes, or
write things somewhere else. Your site plan will be a good place to plan your
theme.

You'll be editing both the `index.html` and `style.css` files, so make sure
you're adding the correct code in the correct file.

Using the lessons from this week, make sure your profile page meets the standard
for web pages. Use the rubric below to make sure you meet the requirements.
While you are encouraged to be creative, your site still needs to be legible.
Don't be so experimental that we can't tell that you know how to make a site.

## Inspiration

You can draw inspiration from your favourite websites. If you need examples of
excellent profile pages, you can use this list as a starting point:

- https://www.sarasoueidan.com/
- https://lolaodelola.dev
- https://jensimmons.com/
- https://slim.computer/
- https://www.swyx.io/
- https://safiyaunoble.com/bio-cv/
- https://jacky.wtf/about
- https://www.tatianamac.com/about
- http://deniseyu.io/
- https://andymatuschak.org/ (this one is a little complex!)

Notice how not all of these sites use white/off-white backgrounds and not all of
them use dark grey text! They also all use different visual techniques to draw
attention to important text.

In this project, try not to default to the standard. If you do, put your spin on
it.
